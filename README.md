## Description
Approprate was developed as the 6th semester IT System project at IIIT Chittoor, Sri City, in a group of 10. Approprate helps clients identify the best rate at which they can buy the vegetables around them. The project was divided into three subgroups. Three applications were developed as for the project: 'Cloud application', 'Client application (Android)', 'Moderator application (Android)' and each subgroups worked on them independently. API is provided by the Cloud application, which is used by the Client application to show the price of vegetables based upon the nearest mandi or a nearby mandi selected by the user. It makes a comparison based upon all the nearby mandis and help the client figure out where to buy the vegetables from. Moderators are assigned for each location and those moderators can update prices for vegetables in their assigned area using the Moderator application. API to the Moderator application is provided by the Cloud application.
